![alt text](image-6.png)

- we want the time slot made by admin. 



- If we keep id and schedule in a table then the relation will be build. It like admin will add the schedule and that will be referenced from the schedule table to the doctors.
- The tables are doctor table, schedule table and doctorid+scheduleid table. 
- We will keep status for that the slot has been booked will never be available on that day.
